# The projective hypothesis: 

>`r fontawesome::fa("quote-left", fill="#f9f6ee")` When people attempt to understand an ambiguous or vague stimulus, their [interpretation]{.underline} of that stimulus reflects their **needs**, **feelings**, **experiences**, **prior conditioning**, **thought processes**, and so forth `r fontawesome::fa("quote-right", fill="#f9f6ee")` [*informed* by @frank1939projective]

## [The Rorschach Inkblot Test](https://youtu.be/LYi19-Vx6go)

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="70%"}

+ General idea of using ambiguous inkblots in testing dates to 1800's
+ Rorschach gained notoriety because he leveraged inkblots to identify [psychological disorders]{.definition}
+ 10 "original" stimuli [widely accessible](https://www.rorschach.org/)
+ goal is for subject's response to reflect [only the subject]{.underline} (zero adminstrator expectation influence)


:::

::: {.column width="30%"}

<br>
<br>

::: {.callout-note}

Rorschach created the stimuli himself by dropping ink on a card, then folding it `r emo::ji("smiling_face_with_sunglasses")`

## Rorschach administration^[note that there are (at least 5) different advocated [administration protocols]{.definition}]

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

+ individually administered with no restriction placed on type of response given
+ generally, [ambiguity]{.underline} is favored over communication of [expectations]{.definition}
  + this is obviously **VERY** different from most test administration contexts
  
:::

::: {.column width="45%"}

+ each card is administered twice (*free--association* & *inquiry* phases)
+ subject [handles]{.definition} the card, which explains why "rotation/ position" at time of response is recorded 

:::

:::

## Rorschach scoring^[as with administration, the lack of standardization means that different users are likely applying vastly different scoring protocols]

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

### Free--association phase:

+ [verbatim responses]{.definition} are typically recorded as well as [duration]{.definition} and [card position]{.definition} 

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

### [Inquiry phase](http://fourstarbooks.net/portfolio/trade/rose-03.pdf): 

::: {.eighty}

  + [location]{.definition} -- section being used (whole, detail, white space)
  + [determinant]{.definition} -- features responded to (form, movement, shading)
  + [form quality]{.definition} -- is answer a "fit" to location of inkblot indicated
  + [content]{.definition} -- name used in response (human, animal, geography)
  + [frequency]{.definition} -- common (to other respondents) or unique

## The @holtzmaninkblot...

...is an alternative inkblot test that addresses common criticisms of the Rorschach (variable number of [respondent answers]{.definition}, lack of administration protocol [standardization]{.definition}, & no [alternative form]{.definition}) 

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}

+ subject only allowed [one response]{.definition} per card
+ administration and scoring are [carefully explained]{.definition} and [standardized]{.definition}
+ two forms (A & B) both consisting of 45 cards

:::

::: {.column width="35%"}

::: {.callout-note}
22 scoring dimensions include direct appraisals of constructs such as [anxiety]{.definition} and [hostility]{.definition}

## Thematic Apperception Test

Intended to evaluating [normal personality characteristics]{.underline}^[note, however, especially with projective tests, [intended]{.definition} and [eventual]{.definition} uses often diverge -- clinicians may believe to have found additional insight beyond what the test developers initially intended] through the lens of @murrayneeds's model of [28 human needs]{.definition} (same theoretical framework as was retained for the [EPPS](https://bookdown.org/jtkulas/chapter13/Chapter13.html#/edwards-personal-preference-schedule-epps)). 

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

+ [30 pictures](https://www.carepatron.com/files/thematic-apperception-test.pdf) + 1 blank card (gender-- & age--specific)
+ no widely--accepted standardized administration or scoring

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.ninety}
::: {.callout-note}
the [achievement]{.definition} motive has traditionally been the need most vigorously evaluated with the TAT
:::
:::

:::
:::

## TAT interpretation

[Response latencies]{.definition} (to first uttered response) are interpreted as possible indicators of difficulty with card interpretation -- as with other projective tests, verbatim responses are also recorded

:::: {.columns}

::: {.ninety}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Common interpretations focus on:

+ [hero]{.bluescript} -- character subject identifies with
+ [needs]{.bluescript} -- what motivates the hero


:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

+ [press]{.bluescript} -- factors interfering with satisfaction of needs
+ [themes]{.bluescript} -- mood or characteristic given (e.g., depression)
+ [outcomes]{.bluescript} -- consequence of story (e.g., success/ failure)

## [Nonpictoral]{.underline} projective procedures...

...ask subjects to respond to requests that don't involve visual stimuli

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="65%"}

:::{.eighty}
[Word Association Test]{.definition} [@jung1910association]

+ respond with first word that comes to mind (after a prompt)

[Sentence Completion Tasks]{.definition}^[might help disclose embarassing information that would be withheld in conversation]

+ partial statements to be completed (e.g., I feel ________ )
