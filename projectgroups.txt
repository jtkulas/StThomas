"key attributes" -- need to define what these are. "forgiveness, conflict resolution, trust, respect, kindness and intimacy" are fine elements -- you need a couple items per element (ideally 3). What is the response scale? (we can work on in lab). Might this be a candidate for dyadic assessment (instead of self-report)?
