## Personality 

+ [Characteristics]{.bluescript} -- "nonintellecitve aspects of human behavior, typically distinguished from mental abilities"
+ [Traits]{.bluescript} -- "enduring dispositions -- tendencies to act, think, or feel in a certain manner"
+ [Types]{.bluescript} -- "general descriptions of people" $\leftarrow$ (categories)
+ [States]{.bluescript} -- "emotional reactions that vary from one situation to another"

## "Structured"^[asking subject to respond to a written statement (aka "objective" tests)] Test Construction Strategies

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

### Deductive strategies:

Define the [content domain]{.definition} (including the theoretical specification of the construct) and then sample items from that domain

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

### Empirical strategies:

Collect data and leverage [statistical associations]{.definition} (typically via correlation and factor analysis) to determine test content (e.g., which items to retain)

## Early Personality Tests^[assumed people were capable and willing to provide honest self--appraisals]

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="47%"}

+ Woodworth Personal Data Sheet [@woodworth] -- purpose was to identify unfit military recruits
  + 116 yes/no questions
  + based on psychiatric interview questions
  + [one]{.definition} overall score
  
:::

::: {.column width="3%"}
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

+ Bell Adjustment Inventory [@BAI]
  + within different [life domains]{.definition} (e.g., work, home)
+ Bernreuter Personality Inventory [@bernreuter]
  + 6 different [traits]{.definition} assessed 

:::

:::

## The MMPI (overview)

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

+ identification of major disorders
+ true/false self--report
+ validity, clinical, & content scales

::: {.callout-note}
8 clinical scales, 2 content scales (masculinity--femininity & social--introversion), & 3 validity scales were the original focus of the MMPI. 

:::

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

::: {.eighty}
+ [validity]{.bluescript} -- information about the person's approach to testing (e.g., did they try to [malinger]{.definition}) 
+ [clinical]{.bluescript} -- identification of psychological disorders (e.g., paranoia, schizophrenia) 
+ [content]{.bluescript} -- descriptive aspects of personality and emotional functioning (e.g., anxiety, anger) 

:::

:::

## MMPI development

Started with a [pool]{.definition} of 1000 items from case histories, psycholigcal reports, textbooks, & other tests. 

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}

+ 550 items administered to psychiatric patients
  + 8 different psychiatric diagnoses
  + what items differentiated [psychiatric patients]{.definition} from [normal population]{.definition} respondents?

:::

::: {.column width="35%"}

::: {.callout-note}
The process of using a known sample to determine which items to retain or delete based on empirical associations is also known as [empirical keying]{.definition}

:::

:::
:::

## MMPI validity scales

What was the test--taker's [attitude]{.definition} & were they [honest]{.definition} while responding?

[L scale]{.bluescript} was designed to detect individuals who present themselves in an [overly favorable]{.definition} manner

[K scale]{.bluescript} was [also]{.underline} designed to detect individuals who present themselves in an overly favorable manner but was [empirically keyed]{.definition}

[F scale]{.bluescript} was designed to detect individuals who present themselves [disfavorably]{.definition} (aka malingering)

## Interpretation

Individual scales [did not]{.underline} do a fantastic job of identifying the 8 focal psychological disorders

Clinicians started to look for [configural patterns]{.definition} [e.g., @meehl1960objective]

::: {.ninety}
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}

Patterns of high (and low) scores across the feedback report constitute a [profile]{.definition}

+ [Might]{.underline} provide more insight regarding presence of disorder

## MMPI--2 [@mmpi2]

Revised to update and expand norms ($n$=2,600), revise "out--of--date" items, create a separate form for adolescents, and broaden the item pool ($k$=567) as well as number of scales/ constructs

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

+ 460 original items retained (however 68 edited for wording)
  + 24 items added for [experimental]{.definition} purposes

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
::: {.callout-note}
the [MMPI--3](https://www.upress.umn.edu/test-division/mmpi-3/) is actually the newest version [@mmpi3] -- computer administration of 335 items in ~30 minutes
:::

## California Psychological Inventory (CPI)

Similar to the MMPI, created via empirical--keying and scored true/ false, [however]{.underline}, the intended population here is [normally adjusted individuals]{.definition}

The 3^rd^ edition [is the most current version](https://shop.themyersbriggs.com/en/cpiitems.aspx?ic=1971&_gl=1*f10xa4*_gcl_au*MTAyMzUzMTkxLjE3NDM1MTY0MzA.) [originally created in 1950's @cpioriginal]

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

+ 36 total scales with hierarchical structure (some of these scales can be combined into [higher--order]{.definition} interpretations)

:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

+ Two versions available -- CPI 434 & CPI 260 (naming is based on the number of items on the inventory)
:::

## Factor Analysis 

Analytical procedure that helps [discover]{.underline} or [confirm]{.underline} the [dimensionality]{.definition} of your measure (e.g., how many aggregate scales should be created from individual item responses?)

## 16 PF^[no "item overlap" -- current favored strategy with multidimensional tests (MMPI & CPI [DO]{.underline} have item overlap and are therefore considered "complex")]

::: {.ninety}
Raymond B Cattell tried using factor analysis to help discover the major dimensions of personality (e.g., [how broad]{.definition} is it?) by administering an exhaustive list of 171 adjectives (aka person descriptors)
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}

+ factor analysis revealed [16 different]{.definition} dimensions that accounted for agreeing or disaggreeing with the 171 items

## Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS)

Example of a primarily "theoretically--derived"^[the textbook categorizations of "how a test is constructed" are not helpful or useful so we're focused on the resulting product (the test itself)] personality inventory that retains @murrayneeds's need system as a theoretical framework ([15]{.underline} specified in EPPS)

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Concerned with [socially desirable]{.definition} responses, so paired items matched in desirability & asked respondents to select the most descriptive item!!



:::

::: {.column width="50%"}

::: {.callout-warning}
::: {.ninety}
This strategy results in some peculiar scoring consequences -- every respondent has the same [total score]{.definition}, but relative allocation of scores is different (this is referred to as   [ipsative]{.definition} measurement)
:::
:::

:::

::::

## NEO (origins)

::: {.ninety}
Some personality assessments are focused on manifestations of psychopathology (e.g., depression, anxiety, schizophrenia) -- an alternative looks for [resources an individual is endowed with]{.definition} that may help them successfully navigate the world 
:::

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}

+ NEO a very popular measure of "positive" personality characteristics
+ originally only assessed 3 traits (each with 6 [facets]{.definition} )
+ Likert--type response options (agreement)

:::

::: {.column width="40%"}

## NEO (contemporary)

Structured to assess dimensions (and facets) of the [five--factor model]{.definition} of personality

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

+ Conscientiousness
+ Agreeableness
+ Neuroticism
+ Openness to Experience
+ Extraversion

Dimension (aka domain) names are reflective of only one [pole]{.definition} of construct continuum -- each has a corresponding opposing--pole alternative
