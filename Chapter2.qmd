# A primary function of tests...

...is to translate [observations]{.pinkscript} into [numbers]{.bluescript}

## How we do this:

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
***Measurement*** -- assignment of [numbers]{.greenscript} to [objects]{.greenscript} according to [rules]{.greenscript}

::: {.callout-note}
The terms `measurement` and `scaling` are widely considered synonymous, however, we’re mostly going to try to reserve use of the term `scale` to refer to item aggregations

## Use of numbers...

:::{.panel-tabset}
### Descriptive

:::{.smaller}
**[Summaries]{.bluescript}**, typically contrasting:

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
+ one group of numbers relative to another group
+ one number relative to a larger group of numbers
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
+ common descriptives:
  + mean, median, mode
  + standard deviation, variance
  + z-score
:::

### Inferential

::: {.smaller}

**[Logical deductions]{.bluescript}** about broader group(s):

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="60%"}
+ do sample differences imply population differences?
+ are sample associations reflective of population effects?
+ realm of p-values (e.g., *p* < .05)
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
+ common inferentials:
  + t-test
  + ANOVA
  + Regression

## Fundamental properties of numbers

+ Numbers are used to represent an individual’s level of standing along a psychological attribute 
  + HOWEVER - Not all numbers retain their CARDINAL PROPERTIES with Psychological measurement

+ Different rules of assignment collectively define different scales of measurement
  + Stevens’ (1946; NOIR) 

:::{.callout-note}
**how** we assign numbers to objects is very important, because if the numbers do not retain their inherent cardinal properties, then perhaps it’s not appropriate to perform mathematical/statistical operations on those numbers...
:::

## Property I

Numbers can reflect “sameness versus differentness” 
Numbers here are merely labels 
Differences in kind/sort/ilk, not in amount
Restrictions:
People in a category (i.e., with same number) are identical in terms of the relevant feature
Categories must be mutually exclusive
Categories must be exhaustive

## Property II

Numbers can also reflect relative amounts of an attribute
Numbers here are again used as labels, but sequence is also being reflected

## Property III

Numbers more typically are used to reflect magnitude of differences between things (for example, a Psychological attribute)
“How much”?
Continuous and “quantitative”
Scores on most psychological tests are usually treated as having the property of quantity

## Property IV

Zero can mean at least two things
Absolute zero--an attribute of an object/event has no existence (e.g., no length)
Arbitrary zero--zero doesn’t necessarily mean “no level of the attribute”
If zero is absolute, can compare scores in terms of ratios (e.g., twice as long)

## Units of measurement

To measure something, we must acknowledge units of measurement (e.g., weight: # of lbs; temp = Fº)
Question for class: What is the unit of measurement in psychology? 

Each test has its own “unit” of measurement (one “point” on an IQ test is not same as one “point” on a math test)
Most often for us, the unit of measurement is a statistical index called the standard deviation:

+ French government wanted to identify mentally disadvantaged
+ Alfred Binet & Theodore Simon developed a ***test*** to help (1905)
  + utilized `standardization` sample (aka norm)

  + today classified as "intelligence" test
  + Terman revised as "Stanford-Binet" (1916)
